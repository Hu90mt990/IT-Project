# Coding standards

The coding standards to follow are based on the MDN Web Docs. The styling guidelines for the following languages are available to read here:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/JavaScript)

Note that React components are written in JSX. A seperate styling guide for writing JSX is found [here](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/).

## Enforcing styling guidelines

Contributors are encouraged to use a formatting program such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format code before committing it.
